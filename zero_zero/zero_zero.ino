/*****************************************************************************
Example sketch for driving Adafruit WS2801 pixels!


  Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit RGB Pixels!
  12mm Bullet shape ----> https://www.adafruit.com/products/322
  12mm Flat shape   ----> https://www.adafruit.com/products/738
  36mm Square shape ----> https://www.adafruit.com/products/683

  These pixels use SPI to transmit the color data, and have built in
  high speed PWM drivers for 24 bit color per pixel
  2 pins are required to interface
